Message Notes
======

This was a simple tool accessed via the Hope Community Church mobile app where users could see the published notes/key points from that weekend's message and also write their own. Then, all the notes could then be emailed to them.

This was an HTML/CSS/JS tool built using Foundation as the front-end framework. A PHP backend was utilized using Mandrill's API in order to send the email to the user.
